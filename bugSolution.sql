The solutions address the errors in the `bug.sql` file.  
-- Data type mismatch solution:
ALTER TABLE employees MODIFY COLUMN salary DECIMAL(15, 2);
-- Incorrect join solution:
SELECT * FROM employees LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
-- Aggregate function without grouping solution:
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department_id;
-- NULL value handling solution:
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary IS NOT NULL AND department_id IS NOT NULL; 
-- More robust NULL handling (e.g., using COALESCE):
SELECT department_id, COALESCE(AVG(salary), 0) FROM employees GROUP BY department_id;

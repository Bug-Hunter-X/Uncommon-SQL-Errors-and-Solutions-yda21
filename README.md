This repository contains examples of uncommon SQL errors and their solutions.  The `bug.sql` file demonstrates incorrect SQL queries that could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The `bugSolution.sql` file provides corrected versions of these queries.  The errors covered include data type mismatches, inappropriate join usage (INNER JOIN instead of LEFT JOIN), incorrect use of aggregate functions without proper grouping, and issues related to NULL values.  Understanding and avoiding these errors is crucial for writing robust and reliable SQL code.

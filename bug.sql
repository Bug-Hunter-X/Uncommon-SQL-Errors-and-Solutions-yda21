In SQL, a common error is using the wrong data type for a column. For example, if you try to store a large number in an INT column, it could cause an overflow error or data truncation.  Another subtle error is using the wrong join type, often leading to incorrect results.  If you use an INNER JOIN when you need a LEFT JOIN, you will miss rows from the left table that do not have matching rows in the right table.  Similarly, incorrect use of aggregate functions without GROUP BY can produce unexpected results. For instance, using AVG(salary) without grouping by department will give you the average salary across all departments, which might not be what is intended.  Finally, a frequently overlooked error is neglecting to properly handle NULL values, which can lead to unexpected results or errors in comparison operations. These NULL-related problems often pop up in WHERE clauses and joins.
